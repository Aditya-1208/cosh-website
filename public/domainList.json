There has been widespread adoption of modern educational applications, ranging from interactive applets, video lessons, and online quizzes to remotely conducting laboratory experiments. Consequently, there is a demand to provide more bandwidth to satisfy users' expectations. <strong><em>Generic Cache</em></strong>&nbsp;is an approach to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in a University campus network and efficiently utilize the available bandwidth.</p> <p>Typically within a University, some requests are similar, e.g., operating system updates, Linux package installs, Python pip packages, and others. These are huge data transfer requests ranging from Megabytes to Gigabytes, and consume a large amount of bandwidth on external access links to the Internet. Redundant requests of this nature from a large user base lead to enormous wastage of bandwidth.</p> <p><strong><em>Generic Cache</em></strong>&nbsp;overcomes this concern by setting up a&nbsp;<em>containerized forward proxy</em>&nbsp;function as a cache for popular traffic in the University. A large number of redundant requests can be successfully served from this Virtualized Network Function (VNF), thereby enhancing the QoS and efficiently utilizing the available bandwidth. Since this cache is implemented as a VNF, it is portable and easy to deploy.</p> <p>The features of Generic Cache are outlined below:</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Rapid setup</h4> <p>Start using Generic with just couple of lines of shell commands on any system. Due to the \"Generic\" nature, it can be used to cache multiple websites without any changes to config/setup process.</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Robust monitoring</h4> <p>Analyze the performance of the system in the network in real-time. Also, get detailed stats if required.</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Secure</h4> <p>Generic cache is as secure as the Gateway used in the network. It has also been quality tested against fishing and DDOS attacks.</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Configurability</h4> <p>Generic cache is extremely configurable. To make things more robust Generic cache also provides&nbsp;<span class=\"code code--inline\">regex parsing</span> out of the box. All these configurations are in a single file and can easily be changed anytime.</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Portability</h4> <p>Generic Cache is implemented as a VNF and thus is portable (both data and process) from one system to another with ease.</p> <h4 class=\"section__title\">Automated data management and logging</h4> <p>Generic Cache out of the box has an automated data management service (which uses LRU strategy) and logging mechanisms for all the collected stats.</p> <p>Read our <a href=\"https://generic-cache.github.io/doc.html\">documentation</a> for more detailed information.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2 class=\"section__title\">Performance statistics</h2> <p>Generic Cache has been deployed in NITK since Jan 2019. The following graphs depict the performance of the system when fuctioning as a Cache for \"Ubuntu\" over a period of 1 month. The Deployed system has proven to be robust in performance in an instituion with over 12k strudents. It has also proven to save significant amounts of data each day and also considerably imporving the speed of internet.</p> <h3 class=\"changelog__title\">The following is a graph shows the overall Miss and Hit ratio of the cache.</h3> <div class=\"changelog__detail\"> <p>From the following graph, we can clearly note that the cache stabilised at&nbsp;<strong>83%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>HIT ratio</strong>&nbsp;ratio and&nbsp;<strong>14%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>MISS ratio</strong>&nbsp;within a week&rsquo;s worth of time.</p> </div> <p><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cosh-website.appspot.com/o/COSH%20website%20assets%2FProjects%20images%2FGeneric%20Cache%2Fcache-fig1.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=e8bb6a6a-e8d2-42f8-a59f-b24b90d5ed15\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p class=\"changelog__title\">The following is a graph shows total traffic recieved and the bandwidth saved on each day</p> <div class=\"changelog__detail\"> <p>From the following graph, we can see that we are able to save about&nbsp;<strong>34GB</strong>&nbsp;of data each day by just caching one website.</p> <p><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cosh-website.appspot.com/o/COSH%20website%20assets%2FProjects%20images%2FGeneric%20Cache%2Fcache-fig2.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=313579d4-82df-430b-b42a-918cae0164a5\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p class=\"changelog__title\">The following tables show the performance of Generic Cache w.r.t Latency and Cuncurrency relative to the origin server.</p> <div class=\"changelog__detail\"> <p>From the following tables, show a clear reduction in latency and increase in availability, throughput and concurrency as compared to the origin server. This improvement is both due to the higher bandwidth of the internal LAN and the significantly smaller size of audience the cache server has to respond at a time, when compared to that of the origin servers.</p> <p><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cosh-website.appspot.com/o/COSH%20website%20assets%2FProjects%20images%2FGeneric%20Cache%2Fcache-fig3.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=1af11b27-7829-4d1d-b3fb-0566d196d7e2\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p>Link to website: <a href=\"https://generic-cache.github.io/\">https://generic-cache.github.io/</a></p> <p>Link to source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/Generic-Cache/Caching-Service\">https://github.com/Generic-Cache/Caching-Service</a></p> <p>Link to documentation: <a href=\"https://generic-cache.github.io/doc.html\">https://generic-cache.github.io/doc.html</a></p> <p>Link to paper: <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9198314\">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9198314</a></p> </div> </div>","name":"Enhancing QoS in a University Network by using Containerized Generic Cache","description":"","id":"eCWYC3aPnF0aVn7cwFtm"},{"content":"<h2>Overview</h2> <p>Network Stack Tester (NeST) is an open-source Python package developed by the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal, India to simplify the process of performing networking experiments.</p> <p>It internally uses Linux network namespaces and provides APIs to create complex emulated networks, run tests and extract the statistics using iproute2, netperf and iperf3 in a single python script as shown in Figure 1 below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cosh-website.appspot.com/o/COSH%20website%20assets%2FProjects%20images%2FNEST%2Fnest-fig1.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=24ec3a9f-8a3b-4d67-b363-e6cfe1d2a021\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p>The &lsquo;Topology Module&rsquo; handles the creation of network namespaces and establishes virtual links for the user by calling the &lsquo;Engine Module&rsquo;, which internally uses iproute2 to create network namespaces and set up virtual links, and the &lsquo;Experiment Module&rsquo; handles traffic generation by using netperf and iperf3, statistics collection and plotting graphs.</p> <p>Multiple instances of the same network topology can co-exist, and different experiments can be run in parallel on every instance because NeST internally maps the user-specified names for namespaces to uniquely generated names using a &lsquo;Topology Map&rsquo;.</p> <p>All these features ensure that using NeST requires fewer prerequisites (that is, prior knowledge of network namespaces to set up virtual testbeds or experience about setting up physical testbeds) and the experiments conducted using NeST can be easily reproduced.</p> <h2>Developed with the future in mind</h2> <p>NeST has been designed and developed taking into consideration the increased interest in the research community to evaluate new transport protocols such as QUIC, BBRv2 and TCP Prague, and new queue disciplines such as FQ-CoDel, CAKE and FQ-PIE. Hence, it provides timestamped JSON (raw) data and plots for congestion window, per-flow throughput, link utilization and queue backlog.</p> <p>Additionally, it is targeted to be used for educational purposes to introduce the fundamentals of networking protocols to Bachelors and Masters graduate students.</p> <p>For more details about NeST, refer to our paper [<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3404868.3406670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">PDF</a>] or watch a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhC7suupR7E&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1797\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">presentation</a>&nbsp;we gave at ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) 2020.</p> <p>It can be quickly installed from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nitk-nest/0.1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">PyPI</a>&nbsp;and the source code is openly available under GPLv2.
